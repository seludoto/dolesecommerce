- Use secure cookies (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE, CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE)
- Regularly update Django and dependencies
- Restrict admin access (use strong passwords, 2FA, IP allowlist)
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Store sensitive data encrypted (passwords, payment info)
- Backup database regularly

## Performance
- Enable caching (Redis/Memcached, Django cache framework)
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Optimize database queries (select_related, prefetch_related)
- Use a CDN for static/media files
- Compress static files (gzip, brotli)
- Use async views for high-latency operations
- Monitor server and database performance (APM, logging)
- Use connection pooling for database
- Run periodic database maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE for Postgres)

## Deployment
- Use gunicorn/uwsgi with Nginx/Apache for production
- Run Django in DEBUG=False mode
- Set ALLOWED_HOSTS properly
- Use environment variables for all secrets and config

   python manage.py migrate payments 0004_mpesab2ctransaction_mpesac2btransaction_phonepayment_and_more --fake
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

- [x] No unnecessary files or cache in the repository
- [x] Static files collected and served correctly
- [x] Admin and frontend tested and working
- [x] Environment variables documented and example provided (`.env.example`)


## Pi Coin Payments Integration
To enable Pi Coin payments in your app, use the official Pi Network JS SDK. This allows users to pay with Pi directly from the Pi Wallet.

### Steps to Integrate Pi Coin Payments
1. **Add the Pi SDK to your template:**
   Add the following script tags to your main template (e.g., `base.html`):
   ```html
   <script src="https://sdk.minepi.com/pi-sdk.js"></script>
   <script>Pi.init({ version: "2.0" })</script>
   ```

2. **Authenticate the user:**
   Before requesting payments, authenticate the user:
   ```javascript
   const scopes = ['payments'];
   Pi.authenticate(scopes, function onIncompletePaymentFound(payment) {
     // Handle incomplete payments
   }).then(function(auth) {
     console.log("User authenticated for Pi payments.");
   }).catch(function(error) {
     console.error(error);
   });
   ```

3. **Request a payment:**
   Use the SDK to prompt the user for payment:
   ```javascript
   Pi.createPayment({
     amount: 3.14, // Amount of Pi
     memo: "Order #1234", // Description for the user
     metadata: { orderId: 1234 }
   }, {
     onReadyForServerApproval: function(paymentId) { /* ... */ },
     onReadyForServerCompletion: function(paymentId, txid) { /* ... */ },
     onCancel: function(paymentId) { /* ... */ },
     onError: function(error, payment) { /* ... */ }
   });
   ```

4. **Handle server-side approval/completion:**
   For advanced flows (App-to-User payments, server confirmation), refer to the [Pi Platform Docs](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs) and their `payments_advanced.md` and `platform_API.md` files.

### Resources
- [Pi Platform Docs](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs)
- [SDK Reference](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs/blob/master/SDK_reference.md)
- [Payments Guide](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs/blob/master/payments.md)

This integration allows your Django app to accept Pi Coin payments securely and easily.

## Running the Project
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Run server: `python manage.py runserver`
5. Access site at `http://localhost:8000/`

## Admin Access
- Login at `/admin/` with superuser credentials

## Notes
- Ensure all static and media files are correctly named and placed
- Use `{% load static %}` and `{% static 'images/logo.png' %}` in templates
- For support, check `core/customer_service.html` and related views

---

## Example Admin/User Credentials
- Admin: Use the credentials created with `python manage.py createsuperuser` to log in at `/admin/`.
- Users: Register via `/users/register/` or create users in the admin panel.

## Sample Data Creation
To quickly add sample products, categories, and brands:
1. Log in to the Django admin at `/admin/`.
2. Add categories, brands, and products using the admin interface.
3. Upload product images via the product or product image forms.
4. Create test orders and payments to see the workflow.

## Troubleshooting Common Errors
- **Static/Media 404s**: Ensure files are named correctly and placed in the right folders. Run `python manage.py collectstatic` if needed.
- **Template Errors**: Always use `{% load static %}` at the top of templates using static files.
- **NoReverseMatch**: Check that your URLs and template tags match the namespaced URL patterns.
- **Image Not Displaying**: Confirm the image path and filename match what is referenced in the template.
- **Database Issues**: Run migrations with `python manage.py migrate` and check for missing fields.

## More Details on Models and Views
- **Category/Brand/Product**: Organize products for easy browsing and filtering.
- **ProductImage**: Allows multiple images per product for better presentation.
- **UserProfile**: Stores extra user info (phone, address, avatar) for personalized experience.
- **Order/Payment/Shipping**: Handles the full purchase and delivery workflow.
- **Review**: Lets users rate and review products.
- **Customer Service**: Provides support, live chat, FAQ, and feedback forms.
